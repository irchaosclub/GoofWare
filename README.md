# Goofware Malware-Library
Malware/Campaign samples we have found &amp; investigated that have some element of humor to them.
- Directly insulting malware analysts
- OPSEC fails
- "Hacking back" in silly ways
- Funny naming schemas
- etc.

&nbsp;

## Categorization
Samples are contained within categorized directories, relating to their context/contribution to this repo. 

The only directory that is not an explicitly separated category is the 'Hall of Fame,' made for our favorite samples.

## Library Format

Category folder > Malware directory > Sample, description, IoCs, etc.

- A sample's master folder may contain the following:
  -   A Writeup from an analyst
  -   Tl;dr synopsis (Delivery vector, objective, notes, etc.)
  -   Archive containing the payload/live malicious binary.


- The live-payload archive will be denoted "[MonthYear] - [MD5 Hash]"
  - **Archive password: "infected"**
  - Content within this zip archive exists as it was originally received. Original filenames, hashes, etc. are preserved.
  - If there are important notes about a sample that need to be in the same folder, they will be written inside this archive as "IRCC-Readme."
